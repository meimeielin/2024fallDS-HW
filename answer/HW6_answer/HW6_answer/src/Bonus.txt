1. As a bonus, the generateChildren method searches for links on the root page and automatically adds a child for each link found. It recursively searches all the children for their children up to a certain depth.

2. Furthermore, findings on subpages are weighed 60% of the parent, so the higher up the hierarchy a keyword is found, the better.

Limitations:
- It only searches for http links. The original code template can't deal with https, my extension doesn't add this functionality.
- It ignores sites that don't load for whatever reason
- It doesn't work with redirects => Sites that automatically redirect to their https version break the tool.

Since most sites preferably use https, the effectivity of the automated search for children is quite low, but it serves as a proof of concept.
